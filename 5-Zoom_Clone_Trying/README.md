## Zoom Landing Page Clone Try

- I've tried to create zoom's landing page clone. I've used HTML,CSS and some Jquery. I think it's old version of zoom. Here is that I try to clone:

- I've finished the first version. It's not responsive (my width: 1540 px) for now and missing solution menu. I could'nt find the same image so I found another img. I hope it's good. Next time I'll try to make it responsive, solutions menu and help button's pop-up. The project is not pixel perfect but I hope you like it. Here is the gif:
